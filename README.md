[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EndFirstCorp/doc2txt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EndFirstCorp/doc2txt) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/EndFirstCorp/doc2txt/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/EndFirstCorp/doc2txt?branch=master)

A native Go reader for the old Microsoft Word .doc binary format files

Example usage:

```go
f, _ := os.Open(testdata)
buf, err := ParseDoc(f)
if err != nil {
  // handle error
}
// buf now contains an io.Reader which you can save to the file system or further transform
```
